# Full‑Stack Coding Challenge

Welcome! During this session, please implement a small feature related to BayesBytes’ platform.

## Task: Course List & Filter

- Fetch data from `data/courses.json` (provided) and display a list of course titles with their categories.
- Add a simple filter input so users can search by course title or category.
- Use **React/Next.js** (Pages or App Router), with state managed via React hooks.
- Style the list and input using **Tailwind CSS** (use minimal styles).
- If you prefer a backend task, alternatively implement a Node/Express route that returns the top 2 highest numbers from an array posted to `/top-two`.

## What We’re Looking For
- Clean, readable code with proper state handling.
- Use of async/await (or fetch) where appropriate.
- Clear separation of concerns (UI logic vs data).
- Ability to explain your thought process.

Feel free to ask clarifying questions during the interview. Good luck!
